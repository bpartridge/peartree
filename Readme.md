Codename PearTree
=================

A custom app for Malcolm Partridge to celebrate his 90th birthday.

# Development

- Download a trial of Trigger.io at trigger.io.
- Add or symlink the `forge` command line tool to your executable path.
- Do `forge create` in an empty directory.
- Remove the boilerplate `src` directory and checkout this code in its place, so for instance you would have the file `PearTree/src/js/main.js`.
- Do `forge build web` and `forge run web` to see it in your web browser.
- Push to a server (i.e. using `forge package web` which instantly publishes to a free Heroku account) to see it on a device.
